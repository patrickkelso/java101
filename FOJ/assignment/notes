when you sell an item, decrement quantity by no.
When you sell an itemised item, decrement as above and also remove the serial number from the list.


This will be useful:
Examples/arrays/PersonStuff.java:Person person = searchByName(people, name    );

product.sell(3); < should work regardless of type of product.
ordinary product just subtract 3 from the stock.
If it's itemised it should ask for serialNumbers.
